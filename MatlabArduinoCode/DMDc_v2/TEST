This is a critical systems identification challenge:

❓ How can I recover the open-loop dynamics of a system if I only have closed-loop data (e.g., from DMDc)?

The answer lies in carefully modeling the controller, and "decoupling" its effect from the closed-loop system.

🔄 Overview: From Closed-Loop to Open-Loop Dynamics
If you collect data under feedback control, what DMDc sees is:

𝑥
𝑘
+
1
=
𝐴
𝑥
𝑘
+
𝐵
𝑢
𝑘
=
𝐴
𝑥
𝑘
+
𝐵
𝐾
𝑥
𝑘
=
(
𝐴
+
𝐵
𝐾
)
𝑥
𝑘
x 
k+1
​
 =Ax 
k
​
 +Bu 
k
​
 =Ax 
k
​
 +BKx 
k
​
 =(A+BK)x 
k
​
 
So your DMDc (if input is 
𝑢
𝑘
=
𝐾
𝑥
𝑘
u 
k
​
 =Kx 
k
​
 ) actually identifies:

𝐴
closed
=
𝐴
+
𝐵
𝐾
A 
closed
​
 =A+BK
Thus:

𝐴
=
𝐴
closed
−
𝐵
𝐾
A=A 
closed
​
 −BK
​
 
If you know the controller gain 
𝐾
K, and DMDc gives you 
𝐴
closed
A 
closed
​
  and 
𝐵
B, you can recover the true open-loop dynamics 
𝐴
A.

✅ Method 1: If You Know the Controller Gain 
𝐾
K
Run DMDc on closed-loop data.

Let 
𝐴
𝑐
=
𝐴
closed-loop
A 
c
​
 =A 
closed-loop
​
  from DMDc.

Use the known controller gain 
𝐾
K to compute:

𝐴
=
𝐴
𝑐
−
𝐵
𝐾
A=A 
c
​
 −BK
That’s your open-loop dynamics.

🔁 This assumes that 
𝑢
𝑘
=
𝐾
𝑥
𝑘
u 
k
​
 =Kx 
k
​
  (i.e., control is a state feedback law).

🧠 Method 2: If You Do Not Know 
𝐾
K — Subspace or Two-Stage DMDc
When 
𝐾
K is unknown, use a two-step system identification strategy to separate the plant from the controller:

🧩 Step 1: Model Controller Behavior
If you have access to both 
𝑥
𝑘
x 
k
​
  and 
𝑢
𝑘
u 
k
​
 , you can fit the controller model:

𝑢
𝑘
=
𝐾
𝑥
𝑘
⇒
Fit 
𝐾
 via linear regression: 
𝑢
𝑘
≈
𝐾
𝑥
𝑘
u 
k
​
 =Kx 
k
​
 ⇒Fit K via linear regression: u 
k
​
 ≈Kx 
k
​
 
This gives you an estimated 
𝐾
^
K
^
 , and now:

🔧 Step 2: Use DMDc Estimate to Recover 
𝐴
A
Run DMDc to get 
𝐴
closed
A 
closed
​
 , 
𝐵
B.

Then use:

𝐴
^
=
𝐴
closed
−
𝐵
𝐾
^
A
^
 =A 
closed
​
 −B 
K
^
 
This gives you a reasonable estimate of the open-loop 
𝐴
A.

🔍 Optional: Use Open-Loop Simulated Input for Validation
To validate your recovered 
𝐴
A, simulate:

𝑥
𝑘
+
1
=
𝐴
𝑥
𝑘
x 
k+1
​
 =Ax 
k
​
 
with zero or small random input, and check if it reproduces known open-loop instability (e.g., pendulum tipping over).
